The following is a brief summary of 53 project by KANAMUGIRE ERIC 224005266 about Student Marks Tracker 
1. Integers:Calculates the sum, average, minimum, and maximum of a list of student marks.
 I started with a list of integers representing the student marks  by various software teams, Then using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions, I calculated: the sum, average, minimum, and maximum of a list of student marks
2. Strings:
   Uses f-strings to generate a clean, readable report of the marks analysis:
    total marks, average marks, minimum and maximum values.
3. Booleans: Threshold-Based Evaluation
   I defined threshold as 80.
    if the average marks exceeds threshold and the maximum marks below 90.
the system will show 'above standard' if not it will show "below standard".
5. Lists: Subject Management
   A subjects list is created, and then elements are added (append), removed (remove), and the entire list is sorted (sort)
Creation of a list of subjects.
Modifying the list by updating and adding elements.
Displaying the original and modified list.

7. Arrays: the script imports the array to create a numerical array from a subset of the marks. It then demonstrates a simple array operation by calculating the sum of its elements
 Creating a numeric array of marks.
Calculating the sum of the array.
8. Dictionaries: Finally, i created a list of dictionary and i manage it 
Managing student records using dictionaries (id, name, value).
Updating a specific student's record.
Deleting a record.
Calculating the total value across all remaining records.
